# Tap Water Godot Template v4.4.1.0
This is a template used to create new godot projects for Godot 4.4.1

## Required Dependencies
There are a few things that you need configured before you can use this template.

1. Godot 4.4.1 .NET should be configured in your PATH. I reccomend doing this using godotenv, but however you get it there is fine.

## Optional Enhancements
Because this template is intended for use with VSCode, there are a few extensions that will make your life easier.

1. Batch runner - This is a plugin that allows you to run .bat files from within VSCode.
2. C# Dev kit - This is a plugin that adds Roslyn (C# lsp) and other nicities to VSCode.
